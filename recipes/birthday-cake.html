        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

      <h3>Steps to Make Chocolate Cupcakes</h3>
      <h5>Step 1</h5>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour
        three 8- or 9-inch-diameter cake pans.
      </p>
      <h5>Step 2</h5>
      <p>
        Cream sugar and butter in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until
        smooth and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add egg yolks, one at a time,
        beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla.
      </p>
      <h5>Step 3</h5>
      <p>
        Sift flour, baking powder, and a pinch salt together into a bowl. Add
        flour mixture to butter mixture in three batches, alternating with milk,
        beating batter briefly after each addition. Scrape down the sides and
        bottom of the bowl and beat for 1 more minute.
      </p>
      <h5>Step 4</h5>
      <p>
        Beat egg whites with a pinch salt in a separate bowl until stiff peaks
        form. Fold 1/3 of the egg whites into cake batter to lighten it; then
        gently fold in remaining egg whites. Pour batter into the prepared pans.
      </p>
      <h5>Step 5</h5>
      <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the cakes springs back when lightly
        touched with a fingertip and a tester inserted into the centers comes
        out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire
        rack.
